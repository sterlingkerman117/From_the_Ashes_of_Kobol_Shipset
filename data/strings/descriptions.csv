,,,,,,
SK_COL_Prometheus,SHIP,"""Built by Colonial Defense Tech Corp., preparing the future of humanity one world at a time."" The pinnacle of CDTC technology, the Prometheus is the ultimate warship, capable of defeating entire fleets singlehandedly. Knowing the desperate costs of most colony fleets, the Prometheus was designed to act as an entire defense fleet, sporting four massive hangars of fighters and bombers, alongside a plethora of weapon batteries and flak cannons. Despite being with energy shields, the armor of the Prometheus is rumored to be impregnable, capable of tanking dozens of nuclear warheads at any single moment without seeming to take a dent. It is said that any colony fleet sporting a Prometheus at its head will always reach their new home unscathed.",,,,
SK_COL_Mercury,SHIP,"""Built by Colonial Defense Tech Corp., preparing the future of humanity one world at a time."" Built upon the success of the Jupiter-class battlestars, the Mercury is a larger and more heavily armored upgrade. Moreover, it sports two additional hangar pods, allowing it to field a significantly higher number of fighters and bombers. Alongside this, the Mercury is armed with two nuclear torpedo launchers and four spinal cannons, giving it the ability to crack any enemy ship’s shielding and armor. Like older battlestars, the Mercury lacks energy shielding and instead sports extremely thick armor and mounts designed for heavy flak weaponry, allowing it to remain in fighting condition for extended periods of time. Any colony fleet with a Mercury at its head is sure to reach its final destination.",,,,
SK_COL_Jupiter,SHIP,"""Built by Colonial Defense Tech Corp., preparing the future of humanity one world at a time."" Large, heavily armed and armored, and sporting two large hangar pods, the Jupiter is the pride of the CDTC and all colony defense fleets. It is the direct successor of the Columbia-class battlestar, sporting numerous upgrades in terms of weapons and armor enhancements. However, like all battlestars, it lacks any energy shielding and instead relies upon its thick armor plating and mounts for heavy flak weaponry for defense. Moreover, the Jupiter is armed with two nuclear torpedo launchers and two spinal cannons, allowing it to deliver a serious punch against any enemy blockade. Even a single Jupiter at the head of a colony fleet is sure to deliver its civilian colonists to their new home safely.",,,,
SK_COL_Jupiter_Stripped,SHIP,"""Built by Colonial Defense Tech Corp., preparing the future of humanity one world at a time."" Large, heavily armed and armored, and sporting two large hangar pods, the Jupiter is the pride of the CDTC and all colony defense fleets. It is the direct successor of the Columbia-class battlestar, sporting numerous upgrades in terms of weapons and armor enhancements. However, like all battlestars, it lacks any energy shielding and instead relies upon its thick armor plating and mounts for heavy flak weaponry for defense. Moreover, the Jupiter is armed with two nuclear torpedo launchers and two spinal cannons, allowing it to deliver a serious punch against any enemy blockade. Even a single Jupiter at the head of a colony fleet is sure to deliver its civilian colonists to their new home safely. This version of the Jupiter, however, was in the process of being scuttled after being replaced by a more powerful Mercury-class battlestar. As such, it lacks a significant portion of its armor plating, making it far mor susceptible to enemy weapons. Despite this weakness, the ship does still maintain most of its critical systems, including its many weapon mounts and its forward torpedo launchers and spinal cannons. To the well planning and clever fleet admiral, this might just be the right ship to give an edge in any battlefield, especially if your colony fleet is on a tight budget.",,,,
SK_COL_Columbia,SHIP,"""Built by Colonial Defense Tech Corp., preparing the future of humanity one world at a time."" Needing a warship capable of acting by itself as the primary defender of an entire fleet of defenseless colony ships, the CDTC designed its first battlestar, the Columbia. Despite its age, the Columbia is still one of the CDTC’s most effective and well-tested colony defense ships, sporting extremely powerful armor and weapons, alongside its two hangar pods full of fighters and bombers. However, like all battlestars, the Columbia lacks any kind of energy shielding technology and instead relies upon its thick armor for protection, resulting in it being a rather slow ship. To make up for this, the energy that would’ve been spent on shielding is put into its weapon systems, allowing it to continue firing without end. The Columbia set the tone for the CDTC’s future at the forefront of colony defense technology, and any forethinking colony designer should always consider the Columbia when planning how to get their colonists to their new home safely.",,,,
,,,,,,
SK_COL_Sabre,SHIP,"""Built by Colonial Defense Tech Corp., preparing the future of humanity one world at a time."" With the success of the new battlestar warships, the CDTC decided to look towards their past of making smaller and more affordable warships, but with the advancements they had made in mind. The Sabre was the result of years of engineering and innovation. Much smaller, but also much faster, the Sabre was built using much of the technology the Mercury-battlestars were made with, just packaged into a smaller vessel. As an assaultstar, the Sabre is designed to act as a support ship to the larger battlestars, moving in to quickly provide cover fire and deliver the final blow wherever possible. It supports a single hangar pod and single forward nuclear torpedo launcher, giving it an edge in any fight against similarly sized vessels. Like all assaultstars and CDTC technology, it gives up energy shielding in place of heavy armor.",,,,
SK_COL_Berzerk,SHIP,"""Built by Colonial Defense Tech Corp., preparing the future of humanity one world at a time."" Heavily armored and armed, the Berzerk is the backbone of any well-developed colony defense fleet. It is an assaultstar capable of delivering wave after wave of either kinetic firepower or heavy flak, depending on how it is outfitted; ending matters with its forward nuclear torpedo launcher. Part of its success is how modular the design is, with numerous medium and small weapon mounts, the Berzerk is capable of being fit for attack or for defense, or a reasonable middle. Like all assaultstars and CDTC technology, it gives up energy shielding in place of heavy armor.",,,,
SK_COL_Valkyrie,SHIP,"""Built by Colonial Defense Tech Corp., preparing the future of humanity one world at a time."" After the success of the Columbia-class battlestar, the Valkyrie was commissioned as a smaller, newer alternative to the powerful and then-expensive battlestars.

Like all assaultstars and CDTC technology, it gives up energy shielding in place of heavy armor.",,,,
SK_COL_Harrier,SHIP,"""Built by Colonial Defense Tech Corp., preparing the future of humanity one world at a time."" The first assaultstar and ship ever designed by the CDTC, the Harrier is the old-faithful of colony defense technology. Despite its age, the Harrier remains a great choice for fleet defense, being extremely well armored and sporting two hangar pods alongside a decent array of weapon mounts. Like all assaultstars and CDTC technology, it gives up energy shielding in place of heavy armor.",,,,
,,,,,,
SK_COL_Trident,SHIP,"""Built by Colonial Defense Tech Corp., preparing the future of humanity one world at a time."" Designed around the same time as the Valkyrie assaultstar, the Tident was built as a smaller destroyer-sized gunstar. With a single small hangar pod and a decent supply of weapon mounts, the Trident fills the gap between expensive assaultstars and relatively weak frigate-sized gunstars. Like all gunstars and CDTC technology, it gives up energy shielding in place of heavy armor. Despite this, however, the Trident is still a relatively fast ship.",,,,
SK_COL_Athena,SHIP,"""Built by Colonial Defense Tech Corp., preparing the future of humanity one world at a time."" Far newer than most CDTC technology, the Athena is faster, cheaper, and yet a still well armed and armored gunstar. It sports two small hangar pods and a decent array of small and medium weapon mounts, and was built to compete with faster and more technologically advanced destroyer-sized warships. Like all gunstars and CDTC technology, it gives up energy shielding in place of heavy armor. Despite this, however, the Athena is still a relatively fast ship.",,,,
SK_COL_Caprica,SHIP,"""Built by Colonial Defense Tech Corp., preparing the future of humanity one world at a time."" Built as an even cheaper alternative to older CDTC vessels, similarly to the Athena, the Caprica is still a viable gunstar sporting two small hangars and a comparable weapon loadout to the Athena. Like all gunstars and CDTC technology, it gives up energy shielding in place of heavy armor. Despite this, however, the Caprica is still a relatively fast ship.",,,,
SK_COL_Amphilochus,SHIP,"""Built by Colonial Defense Tech Corp., preparing the future of humanity one world at a time."" Engineered at the same time as the Valkyrie and Skadi, the smaller Amphilochus-class gunstar is a warship and destroyer through and through. Lacking the usual hangar pods commonly seen on CDTC ships, the Amphilochus is instead armed with four medium weapon mounts, setting it apart from other ships of its size. Meant as a heavy hitter against larger vessels, the Amphilochus is a deadly weapon that can help ensure victory for any colony defense fleet when used correctly by a clever commander. Like all gunstars and CDTC technology, it gives up energy shielding in place of heavy armor. Despite this, however, the Amphilochus is still a relatively fast ship.",,,,
SK_COL_Reynard,SHIP,"""Built by Colonial Defense Tech Corp., preparing the future of humanity one world at a time."" Seeing that fighter-superiority and bomber support gave the CDTC the competitive edge in their shipyards, the CDTC decided to double down on their design theory when they engineered the Reynard. Literally a moving hangar bay, the Reynard sports a comparatively large supply of fighter-craft and bombers for its size. Alongside this, the Reynard also sports a decent array of small weapon mounts, giving it a defensive edge in combat. Like all gunstars and CDTC technology, it gives up energy shielding in place of heavy armor. Despite this, however, the Reynard is still a relatively fast ship.",,,,
,,,,,,
SK_COL_Alberio,SHIP,"""Built by Colonial Defense Tech Corp., preparing the future of humanity one world at a time."" Following the success of the newer assaultstar-class of warships following the Mercury-class battlestar, the CDTC decided they needed to enter the frigate market and so designed the Alberio gunstar. Well armored and very fast, the Alberio also sports a built-in hangar bay alongside a decent weapon array for its size, including two medium mounts. Like all gunstars and CDTC technology, it gives up energy shielding in place of heavy armor. Despite this, however, the Alberio is still a relatively fast ship.",,,,
SK_COL_Guardsman,SHIP,"""Built by Colonial Defense Tech Corp., preparing the future of humanity one world at a time."" Following the success of the newer assaultstar-class of warships following the Mercury-class battlestar, the CDTC decided they needed to enter the frigate market and so designed the Guardsman gunstar. Well armored and very fast, the Alberio also sports two small hangar pods alongside a decent weapon array for its size. Like all gunstars and CDTC technology, it gives up energy shielding in place of heavy armor. Despite this, however, the Gaurdsman is still a relatively fast ship.",,,,
SK_COL_Titan,SHIP,"""Built by Colonial Defense Tech Corp., preparing the future of humanity one world at a time."" A larger version of the Defender-class gunstar, the Titan is one of the CDTC’s new frigate-sized warships designed for colony fleet defense, sporting a built-in hangar pod and a decent array of small weapon mounts. Small colony fleets would do well to consider a few Titans in their fleets if they hope to ensure victory against pirate raiders. Like all gunstars and CDTC technology, it gives up energy shielding in place of heavy armor. Despite this, however, the Titan is still a relatively fast ship.",,,,
SK_COL_Defender,SHIP,"""Built by Colonial Defense Tech Corp., preparing the future of humanity one world at a time."" Following the success of the newer assaultstar-class of warships following the Mercury-class battlestar, the CDTC decided they needed to enter the frigate market and so designed the Defender gunstar. The Defender is the backbone of any frigate-based colony fleet, fulfilling its name by bravely defending unarmed civilian vessels from the threats of piracy or rival colony organizations. It is armed with four small weapon mounts alongside a small hangar pod, giving it a defensive and offensive edge against similarly sized ships. Like all gunstars and CDTC technology, it gives up energy shielding in place of heavy armor. Despite this, however, the Defender is still a relatively fast ship.",,,,
SK_COL_Gremlin,SHIP,"""Built by Colonial Defense Tech Corp., preparing the future of humanity one world at a time."" Still having difficulty competing in the frigate-sized ship market, the CDTC decided to think even smaller. Noting the effectiveness of other small but extremely fast ships, the Gremlin was designed to act as a rapidly moving weapons platform. Sporting two medium weapon mounts and enough armor to make any pirate raider think twice, the Gremlin managed to fill the hole in the CDTC ship portfolio no one believed they could fill, considering their history of building some of the largest ships in the Persean sector. Like all gunstars and CDTC technology, it gives up energy shielding in place of heavy armor. Despite this, however, the Gremlin is still a relatively fast ship.",,,,
