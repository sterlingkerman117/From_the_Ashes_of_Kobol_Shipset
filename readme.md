An attempt at bringing the Battlestar Galactica universe to Starsector.

CREDITS:
All ship sprites are based on artwork created by the talented artist CanisD and also models by the Nightstalker's Universe team.

Unfortunately, it is rumored that CanisD passed away several years ago and his website, Wolf's Shipyard, shutdown. Luckily, however, with some web archive magic I was able to collect most of his BSG ship schematics and designs, allowing me a plethora of content to work with.

Each ship sprite has been cut, modified, shaded, and retextured, as to allow the models to better fit within the Starsector art style. However, despite my meticulous changes, I do not take credit for the original artwork created by either CanisD or the NSU team. Despite this, I do not give permission to use the sprites provided in this mod without permission. I will not be taking any kind of monetary reward for this mod, including donations, as such would be petty in light of the passing of CanisD.

Also, a special thanks to TrueAvarus (Of the UNSF Stargate Mod) for his Nuclear Missiles which I have incorporated a customized version of into this mod. He has also been an extreme help with learning how to mod Starsector.

Thanks also to everyone else who has been supportive and helpful as I have tried to overcome the learning curve of modding Starsector.
